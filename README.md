# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This website was created to help students who are currently in Pre-Work to help take notes, and practice their web building skills. I was motivated to build this site because of how convenient I know it could be to store all of your various study notes on a website, and also how exciting it was to create something that other people could potentially use for their benefits in the future. During this Prework I learnt how to use various Programs such as GitBash and VS Code. I also learnt some basic Javascript  and HTML.

A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
